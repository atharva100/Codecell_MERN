# Codecell_MERN
Repo for codecell mern 

This repo is basically created for submission of the tasks of intro to Webdev course offered by my local college coding club, CodeCell.
I designed a simple static webpage to display the colour chart and the colour wheel using basic html and css knowledge.
Through this task, I learnt how basic webpage designing works and looking forward to dive into webdev projects in the future :)
